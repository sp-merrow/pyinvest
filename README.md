A super simple investment calculator script written in Python.

HOW TO USE:

	-Set yearlyGrowth to decimal growth rate of asset per year

	-Set dividend to dollar amount of YEARLY dividend, set to 0 if N/A

	-Set starting to your initial investment

	-Set investPerMonth to the dollar amount you are investing per month, 0 if N/A

	-Set sharePrice to the current share price of the asset


I just wrote this super quick to help a friend calculate some investments, hopefully this can help someone else.
